      <p>
        Welcome to CineNiche, your go-to source for movie recommendations,
        cinematic deep cuts, and possibly too many Nicolas Cage references.
        While we love drama on screen, we take your privacy off-screen
        semi-seriously. ⸻ 🎬 What We Collect (Yes, We’re Looking At You, But
        Nicely) When you use CineNiche, we may collect: • Your name (especially
        if it’s cool, like Maverick or Hermione) • Your email address (no spam,
        pinky promise) • Your movie preferences (so we don’t recommend Shrek 4
        for the 6th time) • Basic site usage data (pages you visit, buttons you
        click, emotional roller coasters you ride) ⸻ 🍿 How We Use Your Info We
        use your info to: • Recommend movies you’ll actually enjoy (we hope) •
        Improve our service (aka make the site less buggy) • Send you occasional
        updates (only if you’re cool with it) • Argue internally about whether
        Die Hard is a Christmas movie (jury’s still out) ⸻ 🔒 Security We guard
        your data like it’s the last copy of The Godfather on VHS. But remember,
        no system is 100% secure—so please don’t share your credit card number
        or the plot twist to Fight Club. ⸻ 🕺 Third Parties (The Party We
        Weren’t Invited To) We don’t sell, rent, or trade your data. We’re too
        introverted for that kind of social networking. If we ever use
        third-party tools (like analytics), they’ll only get the bare minimum
        data—think popcorn crumbs, not the whole bucket. ⸻ 🌍 International
        Users If you’re visiting from outside the U.S., just know your data is
        processed in the land of free refills and movie theater recliners. ⸻ 🤖
        Cookies Yes, we use cookies. Sadly, not the chocolate chip kind. These
        are small data files that help us remember if you prefer thrillers or
        romantic comedies. You can disable them, but things might look a little…
        weird. ⸻ 🧙 Your Rights You can: • Ask what info we have on you • Tell
        us to delete your info • Suggest better movie recommendations (we’re
        listening) Email us at privacy@cineniche.com or send a carrier pigeon.
        The pigeon will probably get here faster. ⸻ 🚨 Changes to This Policy If
        we change this policy, we’ll update the date above and try not to
        confuse you. If the changes are big, we might even tell you. Maybe. ⸻ 💌

        Matrix trilogy? Email us at: privacy@cineniche.com
